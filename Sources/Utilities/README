The python files tifffile.py and WriteTiff.py are intended to be in the same 
directory than their matlab counterparts WriteTiff.m.
These python functions are called from matlab to convert between tiff files 
and mat files. On some operating systems calling a python function from 
matlab changes the enviromment seen by the python function, which can lead
to incompatibilities between python librairies and matlab libraries. In case
it happens, you should execute manualy the python function in a terminal
copy-pasting the command displayed in matlab.
